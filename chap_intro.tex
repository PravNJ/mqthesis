P-Cygni type stars exhibit P Cygni profiles, which are spectral components that show characteristic absorption, emission and wide absorption sub-components. Depending on the location of the foremost absorption component (either blue- or redshifted), P Cygni profiles can be subdivided into two classes: namely P Cygni, and the  redshifted counterpart inverse P Cygni (). Stars that exhibit these profiles in their spectra are considered to have two components and processes that contribute to these spectral lines (\cite{zhang2021catalog}). \cite{1953PDAO....9....1B}
