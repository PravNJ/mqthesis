\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my wife Gazala who supported me and pushed me to do more astronomy. I would not be completing this work if not for her. I would also like to thank my family in Sri Lanka who support everything I do and encouraged me to follow my interests no matter what from a very young age. 

A big thank you to my supervisor Dr Daniel Zucker who in addition to providing valuable feedback, believed in me every step of the way. Thank you to Dr Ben Montet at UNSW
